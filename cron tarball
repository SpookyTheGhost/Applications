linux doesn't care about file extensions as it means nothing

sudo tar -cvpzf filename.tar.gz --exclude = /mnt /
c: create or overwrite backup file
v: logs
p: preserves permissions
z: compress (tarball)
f: filename

/ is root directory
x: extract
xvpz


sudo crontab -e
m h dom m dow comm
[0-59] [0-23] [1-31] [1-12] [0-6]
